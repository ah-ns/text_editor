# text_editor

## About
This is a project to increase my knowledge with C and understand how text editors work.
I hope to learn about new data structures that allow for quick changes to a file and increase my knowledge about how memory works.

The inspiration for this project came from Austin Z. Henley's blog at: https://austinhenley.com/blog/challengingprojects.html
